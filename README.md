##UNIX SHELL - Version 1.0 ##
This is a simple shell that uses execvp to execute commands, with cd functionality.
Use on a unix system in the terminal

The shell command './configure && make && make install'
should configure, build, and install this package from the .tar.gz file

It can then be run by the shell command:
./assign2_21315391

To write to a file, just do
$ (your command) > filename
where filename is the name of your desired destination file.

**Doing CTRL + C will not exit the shell program**

*any command before or after CTRL + C will be ingnored*
